# Smart Motion Detector using PIR Sensor & Arduino
  
This project uses a **PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor** and **Arduino UNO** to automatically turn an LED ON when motion is detected and OFF when it‚Äôs calm and quiet again.

## Project Overview

This mini project shows how **motion detection** works using a **PIR sensor**.  When someone walks in front of the sensor, it sends a signal to Arduino ‚Äî and boom the LED turns ON!  Once there‚Äôs no movement, the LED turns OFF automatically.  
A perfect first step into **IoT**, **home automation**, or **security systems**. 

## Components Required

| Component |  Quantity |  Description |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Arduino UNO | 1 | The main controller board |
| PIR Motion Sensor | 1 | Detects movement of humans |
| LED | 1 | Glows when motion is detected |
| Jumper Wires | As needed | To connect components |

## Circuit Connections

| PIR Sensor Pin | Connects To | Description |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| VCC | 5V on Arduino | Power supply |
| GND | GND on Arduino | Ground |
| OUT | Digital Pin 2 | Sends motion signal |

| LED Pin | Connects To | Description |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| + (Anode) | Digital Pin 13 | LED Control |
| ‚Äì (Cathode) | GND | Ground connection |

## Applications Description

1. Smart Home Lights	Automatically turn ON lights when someone enters a room
2. Classroom Automation	Save energy by switching off unused lights
3. Office Security	Detect intruders after work hours
4. Automatic Doors	Trigger opening systems using motion sensors

## Project Outcome
1. When motion is detected ‚Üí LED turns ON
2. When stillness returns ‚Üí LED turns OFF
3. Energy-saving, efficient, and smart ‚Äî just like the future!
